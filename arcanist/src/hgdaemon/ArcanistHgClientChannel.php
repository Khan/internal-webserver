 * implements the other half of the protocol: it decodes messages from the
 * client and encodes messages from the server.
 *
 * Because the proxy server speaks the exact same protocol that Mercurial
 * does and fully decodes both sides of the protocol, we need this half of the
 * decode/encode to talk to clients. Without it, we wouldn't be able to
 * determine when a client request had completed and was ready for transmission
 * to the Mercurial server.
 *
 * (Technically, we could get away without re-encoding messages from the
 * server, but the serialization is not complicated and having a general
 * implementation of encoded/decode for both the client and server dialects
 * seemed useful.)
