/**
 * Server which @{class:ArcanistHgProxyClient} clients connect to. This
 * server binds to a Mercurial working copy and creates a Mercurial process and
 * a unix domain socket in that working copy. It listens for connections on
 * the socket, reads commands from them, and forwards their requests to the
 * Mercurial process. It then returns responses to the original clients.
 *
 * Note that this server understands the underlying protocol and completely
 * decodes messages from both the client and server before re-encoding them
 * and relaying them to their final destinations. It must do this (at least
 * in part) to determine where messages begin and end. Additionally, this proxy
 * sends and receives the Mercurial cmdserver protocol exactly, without
 * any extensions or sneakiness.
 *
 * The advantage of this mechanism is that it avoids the overhead of starting
 * a Mercurial process for each Mercurial command, which can exceed 100ms per
 * invocation. This server can also accept connections from multiple clients
 * and serve them from a single Mercurial server process.
