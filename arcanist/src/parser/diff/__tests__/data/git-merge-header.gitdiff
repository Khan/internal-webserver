    fbi.have_debug() to disappear

    Summary:
    fbi.have_debug() is boring because libfbi has no --enable-debug-log
    option - the only question is whether the debugging will do anything (if
    libasox or libmc has --enable-debug-log). So it always returns true. It
    will probably go away, and this is the change to go with that.

    Test Plan:
    python test/test.py -d 1
