/**
 * Runtime workflow configuration. In Arcanist, commands you type like
 * "arc diff" or "arc lint" are called "workflows". This class allows you to add
 * new workflows (and extend existing workflows) by subclassing it and then
 * pointing to your subclass in your project configuration.
 *
 * When specified as the **arcanist_configuration** class in your project's
 * ##.arcconfig##, your subclass will be instantiated (instead of this class)
 * and be able to handle all the method calls. In particular, you can:
 *
 *    - create, replace, or disable workflows by overriding buildWorkflow()
 *      and buildAllWorkflows();
 *    - add additional steps before or after workflows run by overriding
 *      willRunWorkflow() or didRunWorkflow() or didAbortWorkflow(); and
 *    - add new flags to existing workflows by overriding
 *      getCustomArgumentsForCommand().
 *
 * @group config
 * @concrete-extensible
