If "curl.cainfo" is not set (or you are using PHP older than 5.3.7, where the
option was introduced), libphutil uses the "default.pem" certificate authority
bundle when making HTTPS requests with cURL. This bundle is extracted from
Mozilla's certificates by cURL:

  http://curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.html

If you want to use a different CA bundle (for example, because you use
self-signed certificates), set "curl.cainfo" if you're using PHP 5.3.7 or newer,
or create a file (or symlink) in this directory named "custom.pem".

If "custom.pem" is present, that file will be used instead of "default.pem".

If you receive errors using your "custom.pem" file, you can test it directly
with `curl` by running a command like this:

  curl -v --cacert path/to/your/custom.pem https://phabricator.example.com/

Replace "path/to/your/custom.pem" with the path to your "custom.pem" file,
and replace "https://phabricator.example.com" with the real URL of your
Phabricator install.

The initial lines of output from `curl` should give you information about the
SSL handshake and certificate verification, which may be helpful in resolving
the issue.
