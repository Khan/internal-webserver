/**
 * Object that writes to a logfile when it is destroyed. This allows you to add
 * more data to the log as execution unfolds, while still ensuring a write in
 * normal circumstances (see below for discussion of cases where writes may not
 * occur).
 *
 * Create the object with a logfile and format:
 *
 *   $log = new PhutilDeferredLog('/path/to/access.log', "[%T]\t%u");
 *
 * Update the log with information as it becomes available:
 *
 *   $log->setData(
 *     array(
 *       'T' => date('c'),
 *       'u' => $username,
 *    ));
 *
 * The log will be appended when the object's destructor is called, or when you
 * invoke @{method:write}. Note that programs can exit without invoking object
 * destructors (e.g., in the case of an unhandled exception, memory exhaustion,
 * or SIGKILL) so writes are not guaranteed. You can call @{method:write} to
 * force an explicit write to disk before the destructor is called.
 *
 * Log variables will be written with bytes 0x00-0x1F, 0x7F-0xFF, and backslash
 * escaped using C-style escaping. Since this range includes tab, you can use
 * tabs as field separators to ensure the file format is easily parsable. In
 * PHP, you can decode this encoding with `stripcslashes`.
 *
 * If a variable is included in the log format but a value is never provided
 * with @{method:setData}, it will be written as "-".
 *
 * @task log        Logging
 * @task internal   Internals
 * @group filesystem
