================================
RBTools 0.2 Beta 2 Release Notes
================================

**Release date**: September 21, 2009.


post-review
===========

New Feature
-----------

* Installing RBTools now installs :command:`post-review.exe` on Windows.

* Added support for posting paths of files against Perforce repositories
  instead of change numbers. This can be used for posting specific files that
  were already committed. Revision numbers can also be specified.

  The `post-review documentation`_ covers how to use these new parameters.

  Patch by Eric Huss.

* Added support for :option:`--parent`, :option:`--guess-summary`, and
  :option:`--guess-description` for :command:`hgsubversion`. Patch by
  Augie Fackler.

* post-review no longer needs simplejson if using Python 2.6.

* Added repository UUID support for :command:`git-svn`. This works the same
  way as SVN's repository UUID support. Patch by Matthew Woehlke.

* Diffs generated for Git now contain the full SHA1s instead of the shortened
  form, which is needed for Review Board servers using GitHub or other similar
  services and configured with raw URL support for fetching files from Git.

Bugs Fixed
----------

General
~~~~~~~

* Fix an infinite recursion problem during login with invalid cookies.
  Patches by Eric Huss and Chris Clark. (:bug:`808`)


ClearCase
~~~~~~~~~

* Our ClearCase support no longer breaks post-review if :command:`cleartool`
  isn't installed.

* We now generate revision strings properly with ClearCase. They were missing
  a space, squashing parameters together.


Git
~~~

* The local repository configuration (:file:`.reviewboardrc`) wasn't being
  read with Git repositories.


Mercurial
~~~~~~~~~

* Fix the Mercurial support so that it doesn't assume a repository is a
  hg-svn repository incorrectly.


Perforce
~~~~~~~~

* Our Perforce support would break with files containing spaces in the path.
  Patch by Steven Russell. (:bug:`840`)

* Fix line termination issues with Perforce when files coming in have
  ``\r\r\n`` termination. We now normalize these to ``\r\n``. This can
  happen in some Perforce setups when dealing with a file checked out from one
  platform and modified on another. Patch by Raghu Kaippully. (:bug:`1071`)

* Changes with binary files could break the generated diffs with Perforce.
  Patch by Chris Trimble.

* We now mark temporary files as read/write instead of write-only in the
  Perforce support, to prevent problems on Windows. (:bug:`1143`)

* :command:`gdiff` (GNU diff) is now used on Solaris instead of
  :command:`diff` when using Perforce. Solaris's :command:`diff` is
  incompatible with post-review.


Subversion
~~~~~~~~~~

* URLs weren't always properly joined for SVN repositories on
  Windows. Patch by Jeremy Bettis. (:bug:`939`)
