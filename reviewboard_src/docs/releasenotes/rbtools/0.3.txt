===========================
RBTools 0.3.0 Release Notes
===========================


**Release date**: January 30, 2011


Features
========

post-review
-----------

* Added support for the new Review Board 1.5.x API.

  This requires Review Board 1.5.2 or higher. New features will only implement
  support for the new API, as the old API in 1.0.x is deprecated and being
  removed in Review Board 1.6.

  On Review Board 1.5.0 and 1.5.1 servers, this will continue to use the old
  API, as we require some fixes and enhancements only available in 1.5.2 and
  higher.

  Support for older Review Board servers may be removed in a future release,
  but there aren't any specific plans at this point.

* Added a :option:`--reopen` parameter for reopening an existing review
  request. This requires passing the :option:`-r` parameter. Patch by Jan
  Koprowski. (:bug:`1607`)

* The debug log now contains the RBTools version and home directory, in order
  to aid debugging.


ClearCase
---------

* Added support for :option:`--revision-range` on ClearCase. Patch by Jan Koprowski.
  (:bug:`1588`)

* Added support for :option:`--repository-url` on ClearCase. This can be used
  to specify an alternate dynamic view. Patch by Jan Koprowski.

* Added support for directory diffs on ClearCase. Patch by Jan Koprowski.
  (:bug:`1626`)


CVS
---

* Added support for :option:`--revision-range` and individual files for CVS.
  Patch by Daniel LaMotte. (:bug:`1852`)


Mercurial
---------

* Added support for reading ``reviewboard.url`` from a local :file:`hgrc`
  file for Mercurial. Patch by Dan Buch.

* Added support for posting reviews of locally-committed changes (instead of
  requiring that all changes be uncommitted). Patch by Dan Buch.

* Added support for :option:`--parent` for parent branches. Patch by Dan Buch.


Perforce
--------

* Added a new :option:`--p4-passwd` command line option.

  This allows a user to supply a Perforce Ticket or clear-text password,
  which is useful in cases where the Perforce password or ticket is not
  available in the environment where post-review is run. Patch by Ryan Shelley.


Plastic SCM
-----------

* Added support for `Plastic SCM`_.

  This supports changeset IDs and branch specifications as the diff argument,
  and is known to work with the latest version of Plastic SCM. Patch by Dick
  Porter.

  This requires Plastic SCM support in Review Board, which will be available
  in 1.6.

Bug Fixes
=========

post-review
-----------

* The :py:mod:`json` module is now only imported if it's the one we expect.
  We look for Python 2.6's version of the :py:mod:`json` module specifically,
  and disregard the third-party :py:mod:`json` module, which is not compatible.
  If the third-party one is found, we try to import :py:mod:`simplejson`
  instead.

* The login cookie is no longer used when providing the
  :option:`--username`/:option:`--password` or :option:`--submit-as`
  parameters. That was preventing these options from working as they should
  have. (:bug:`762`)

* post-review no longer crashes if the cookie can't be saved. Instead, we
  log some debug output and proceed. (:bug:`1557`)

* Fixed cookie storage when using bare hostnames (such as ``http://reviews/``).
  Patch by Noah Kantrowitz.

* post-review provides a better error message when the generated diff is
  empty. Patch by Ben Hollis.

* post-review provides better error messages when failing to find
  repositories. If matching against multiple found repositories, we display
  each repository we found and each valid repository. Patch by Dana Locaste.
  (:bug:`1717`)


ClearCase
---------

* We no longer hard-code the ``VIEWTYPE:`` information in descriptions in ClearCase.
  Patch by Jan Koprowski. (:bug:`1610`)

* Fixed support ClearCase deployments where VOBs are mounted as
  subdirectories of :file:`/vobs`. Patch by Bryan Halter. (:bug:`1421`)


Git
---

* Fixed working with code on branch names with slashes in the name. Patch by
  Petr Novák.

* We now prevent external diff tools from being used when generating a diff on
  Git. Users could have a :file:`.gitconfig` that specified an alternate diff
  tool, which would break with post-review. (:bug:`1524`)

* We now check for the existence of :file:`.git/svn` and for any files
  in that directory before calling ``git svn info``. This speeds up use on all
  standard Git repositories and prevents the generation of the
  :file:`.git/svn` directory.


Mercurial
---------

* The Mercurial support does a better job of checking for a hgsubversion
  clone. Patch by Dan Buch.


Perforce
--------

* Speed up creating diffs for a range of files. We are now smarter about the
  file and revision comparisons when generating diffs. Patch by Gyula Faller.

* post-review provides a more meaningful error message when a Perforce
  changelist doesn't exist or when there aren't changes in the changelist.
  Patch by Ben Hollis. (:bug:`832`)

* If no change number is provided, Perforce will default to the ``default``
  changelist. Patch by Ben Hollis. (:bug:`1191`)

* Support ``move/delete`` changes in Perforce.

  A ``move/delete`` change wouldn't be properly flagged and processed. We now
  treat it as a delete, as there will be a corresponding file add to go with
  it.

  Patch by Gordon McGregor.


Subversion
----------

* Fixed problems with detecting relative paths when using Subversion.

  Depending on the repository configuration on the Subversion server and on
  Review Board, we would fail to find the correct repository. This was first
  reported with Apache's Review Board setup.

  Patch by Andrew Stitcher.
