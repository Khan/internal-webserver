===========================
RBTools 0.3.1 Release Notes
===========================


**Release date**: February 7, 2011


Features
========

post-review
-----------

* Added a :file:`.reviewboardrc` setting for specifying the repository to use.
  (:bug:`1803`)

  By default, post-review tries to figure out the repository path to use
  when creating a new review request. This works fine on simpler setups, but
  setups involving very different URLs (such as when a username is involved
  in the URL) it falls apart.

  Now, users can add a ``REPOSITORY = '...'`` setting in
  :file:`.reviewboardrc` to specify the repository path or numeric ID to
  match.

  If using Review Board 1.5.3 or higher, you can use the repository's
  human-readable name (for example, "Review Board" or "RBTools") instead.


Bug Fixes
=========

post-review
-----------

* Fixed a crash when using the old, deprecated API and accessing an existing
  review request. (:bug:`1972`)

* Updated the version of Python Setuptools that we install if the system
  doesn't already have it, since the version we used before no longer exists.
