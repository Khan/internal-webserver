======================================
Review Board 1.1 Alpha 1 Release Notes
======================================

**Release date**: September 20, 2009


New Features
============

Review Requests
---------------

* An update bubble now appears in the lower-right of the review request page
  when a new diff is uploaded, the review request is updated, or a new
  review or reply has been posted. The bubble tells what updated, by who, and
  allows updating the page.

* Improved the auto-complete of users and groups when specifying reviewers.
  We now search the username, first name and last name of people, and
  both the group name and group's display name for groups. The full name
  for users and display name for groups are shown next to the username and
  group name in the auto-complete dropdown. (:bug:`598`)

* Screenshots can now be uploaded by dragging from the file manager into
  the review request. This functionality currently requires a modern
  `Google Gears`_ on a supported browser. (Note that as of Google Gears
  0.5.32.0, support with Firefox 3.5+ is broken. This should be fixed in
  an upcoming release).

* Uploading screenshots no longer causes the page to reload. They're now
  uploaded and inserted directly into the page.

* Pending changes on Perforce servers now have a "(pending)" indicator next to
  the change number.

Diff Viewer
-----------

* Added the ability to toggle the visibility of whitespace-only lines in
  the diff viewer. New :guilabel:`Show Whitespace changes` and
  :guilabel:`Hide Whitespace changes` buttons dynamically toggle whether
  lines containing only whitespace changes (such as the addition or
  removal of trailing whitespace) should be shown in the diff viewer. This
  can help cut down large diffs that contain many lines of whitespace changes.

  This functionality was written by Eduardo Felipe Castegnaro as part of his
  2009 Google Summer of Code project.

* An update bubble now appears in the lower-right of the diff viewer
  when a new diff is uploaded. The bubble tells what updated, by who, and
  allows updating the page.


E-Mail Support
--------------

* Review Board now sends HTML e-mails. The e-mails are structured similarly
  to the review request page, and show the fragments of the diffs and
  screenshots that are being commented on. It also shows any thumbnails
  on the review request and has links to associated bugs.

  E-mail clients set to disallow HTML e-mails will continue to see the old
  plain text e-mails.

* Added ``X-ReviewBoard-URL`` and ``X-ReviewRequest-URL`` headers to all
  e-mails sent out. These can be used for advanced filtering of e-mails into
  different folders. ``X-ReviewBoard-URL`` contains the URL to the Review
  Board server, and ``X-ReviewRequest-URL`` contains the URL to the
  particular review request undergoing discussion.


User Accounts and Authentication
--------------------------------

* Users who lost their passwords can now reset their password on the
  login screen. An e-mail will be sent to their account with instructions
  on resetting the password.

* Added the ability to use X.509 certificates for authenticating users.
  This is useful for Review Board servers in environments with a Public Key
  Infrastructure set up. Patch by Nathan Heijermans.


Administration UI
-----------------

* Made it easier to configure Review Board with various bug trackers and
  code hosting services. The Repository configuration page now gives
  administrators the option of choosing between various hosting services
  (currently Bitbucket, GitHub, Google Code, or SourceForge) and
  bug trackers (Bitbucket, Bugzilla, Google Code, Redmine, SourceForge, or
  Trac).

  When chosen, the more complex fields such as the repository URL go away,
  and simpler fields such as the project name will appear. This makes the
  process of configuring Review Board with public services much easier.

* Added remote Git support. Previously, Review Board required local clones
  of a Git repository that were always up-to-date. Now we support a form of
  remote Git by downloading raw files over HTTP. This does require certain
  setups on the Git server, though.

  Git itself doesn't give us the remoting abilities we normally require, but
  if the Git repository is set up with a web repository browser (such as
  Gitosis, cgit, gitweb, or GitHub), then a special "raw file" URL can be set
  that will allow Review Board to download the required file over HTTP. When
  using the GitHub hosting service configuration in the Repository page, this
  is automatically set.

* Default Reviewer entries can now be tied to one or more repositories.
  By default, they still cover all known repositories. The Default Reviewers
  configuration page has also been revamped for better usability and error
  checking.

* A Server Log page has been added for viewing the server log file,
  filtering it, and sorting it. Lines are color-coded based on severity.
  You can get to this new page by clicking :guilabel:`Server Log` on the
  Administration Dashboard.

* The tab bar for the Settings pages now shows the current page you're on.

Bug Fixes
=========

(These are bugs fixed since the 1.0.3 release. Bugs in this list may
end up in future 1.0.x releases before Review Board 1.1 is out.)

* When using Active Directory, group membership is now only checked when an
  actual restriction on groups is active. (Workaround for :bug:`1267`)
