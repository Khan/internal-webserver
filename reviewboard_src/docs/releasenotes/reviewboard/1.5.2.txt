================================
Review Board 1.5.2 Release Notes
================================


**Release date**: January 10, 2011


Important Updates
=================

* Users using existing WSGI configurations must update their configuration
  for authentication with the new API to work.

  By default, the ``HTTP_AUTHORIZATION`` flag we use for authentication
  is stripped from requests when using WSGI. For new sites created with
  Review Board 1.5.2, you won't encounter any problems, but existing
  users will have to update their configuration to make this work.

  To fix this, add the following to your configuration::

      WSGIPassAuthorization On

  And make sure you have this line as well::

      WSGIScriptAlias "/" "/path/to/site/htdocs/reviewboard.wsgi"

  If you have a subdirectory installation, replace ``"/"`` with
  the subdirectory (and include a trailing slash).


New Features
============

* Added SSH key management for SSH-backed repositories.

  A new SSH settings page has been added to the administration UI for
  creating a new SSH key, uploading an existing SSH key, or viewing a
  configured SSH key. This SSH key will be owned and managed by Review Board,
  and can be used for working with SSH-backed repositories.

  After Review Board is configured with a SSH key, the SSH settings page
  will show information on the SSH key, including the public key. The public
  key can be used on the repository's end to grant Review Board permission to
  access the repository.

* Authentication failures when setting up repositories are now more useful.

  When failing to authenticate with a repository, we provided a very unhelpful
  error talking about the username and password being wrong. However,
  sometimes the username/password aren't even allowed, and the real factor is
  the public key. In those cases, the user wouldn't even know.

  Now we refrain from mentioning specifics, but instead list of authentication
  types we know were tried. This of course assumes the backend is using this
  new error, which right now is only used for SSH errors.

  When we get an authentication error that mentions that a public key is an
  acceptable form of authentication, and no public key has been generated on
  the server, we tell the user this and give them a link (which opens in a new
  tab/window) to generate a new key.

* Added our own SSH replacement for standardizing on behavior and working
  around OpenSSH limitations.

  We now provide our own SSH wrapper that allows us to use a Review Board
  installation's configured SSH key. OpenSSH and possibly other SSH
  implementations used the web server's user's home directory, and this was
  often hard-coded on systems to a non-writeable directory, preventing
  SSH from working out of the box.

  This shouldn't affect any access to repositories negatively, but any
  issues that do come up should be reported so we can diagnose them.

* The Repository page in the administration UI now talks about API Tokens
  and links to the GitHub Account page for Git repositories, making it easier
  to set up a GitHub repository.


API Fixes
=========

* Fixed logging in on requests using HTTP Basic Auth.

  There were issues preventing proper login when using HTTP Basic Auth.
  Sending an HTTP_AUTHORIZATION header would fail to log in the user if it
  wasn't in response to a HTTP 401 Unauthorized. This meant that
  clients couldn't log in with their first request, and users wouldn't
  know that the credentials were invalid until later.

  Now clients can send a HTTP_AUTHORIZATION with any request to trigger
  a log in.

* Fixed wrong responses when performing a request requiring authentication
  as an anonymous user.

  Any request made that required a logged in user would return an
  HTTP 403 Forbidden, instead of requesting that the client log in. Now
  it'll send HTTP 401 Unauthorized instead, prompting the client to log in.

* Fixed anonymous access to the API when anonymous access is enabled.

  Even when the Review Board server is set to allow anonymous access, the API
  wouldn't always allow access without first logging in. Now the anonymous
  access setting is being checked correctly.

* Fixed replies to screenshot comments in the new web API.

  While saving a reply would appear to work, it would never be associated with
  the review.

* Fixed removing screenshots from review requests.

  The API now allows for removing screenshots from a review request draft
  by sending a HTTP DELETE to the screenshot's resource.

* Changed the request when doing a ``HTTP PUT`` on a review request draft.

  Previously, when doing an ``HTTP PUT`` with ``public=`` on a draft, the
  response would be a ``HTTP 303 See Other``, which redirected to the draft.
  While useful in theory, this made any interaction with in-browser
  AJAX libraries impossible, as the browser would hide the redirect,
  preventing the client from properly handling the request or even really
  returning the expected result (JSON or XML).

  Now, we just return the same payload that other updates to the resource
  returned, which is more consistent and reliable. The result will contain
  the draft of the review request.

* Fixed search queries in :file:`/api/users/`.

  Passing ``?fullname=`` to the users resource would result in an HTTP 500
  error. The query being constructed on the server was wrong.


Bug Fixes
=========

* Fixed a problem with SSH host checking on Git repositories.

  SSH host checking on Git repositories was busted when using the
  ``user@address:/path`` form, without a leading ``ssh://``. We were
  using the raw provided path, and not the normalized path, when doing the
  verification. Since it didn't appear as a SSH path, the host wasn't
  checked.

* Fixed support for private GitHub repositories.

  SSH URLs containing a username weren't being parsed correctly, leading
  to a problem when attempting to access private GitHub repositories and
  other SSH-backed repositories.

  We also weren't matching private GitHub repositories in the repository
  page in the administration UI.

  This should fix problems for both standard and organization repositories.

* The API Token for GitHub repositories are now extracted properly in the
  Repository page in the administration UI.

* Fixed extra whitespace highlight toggling.

  There were bugs in toggling extra whitespace highlighting for loaded
  diffs. Now it should work for all diffs. Patch by Mikhail Rogozhin.

* Images on the dashboard are now cached, reducing the number of
  requests made to the server. Patch by Ben Hollis.

* Disabled auto-complete and default values for the repository
  username/password fields.

  Web browsers like to supply defaults for username/password fields, based on
  any account on the site, but these are almost always wrong for the
  repositories. We now turn off the ``autocomplete`` flag on these fields to
  tell the browsers not to fill in the fields or offer auto-complete.

* Support for Amazon S3 now works again with new versions of
  Django Storages.

* Authentication with the new API now works with new Apache+wsgi setups.

  By default, mod_wsgi prevents our API's authentication from working.
  The ``WSGIPassAuthorization On`` setting must be added to the Apache
  configuration file. This is now added for brand new sites.

* Fixed some rewrite rule for fastcgi.

  The RewriteRules for fastcgi referenced :file:`/docs/` and not
  :file:`/errordocs/`, causing the error pages to not show up correctly. It
  also failed to work with ``mod_fastcgi`` at all, only ``mod_fcgid``.

  This fix only applies to new installs. Existing installs will have to
  modify their RewriteRules manually to::

    <IfModule mod_fcgid.c>
        RewriteRule ^/(media.*)$ /$1 [QSA,L,PT]
        RewriteRule ^/(errordocs.*)$ /$1 [QSA,L,PT]
    </IfModule>
    <IfModule mod_fastcgi.c>
        RewriteRule ^/(media.*)$ /$1 [QSA,L,PT]
        RewriteRule ^/(errordocs.*)$ /$1 [QSA,L,PT]
    </IfModule>

* Fix 404 errors with newly generated :file:`lighttpd.conf` files.

  Several installs with lighttpd have been causing 404 errors due to a broken
  The generated :file:`lighttpd.conf` now contains a rewrite rule that
  fixes this.

  For existing installations, add the following to your ``url.rewrite-once``
  block::

      "^(/reviewboard.fcgi.*)$" => "$1",

* Fixed errrors when passing a non-integer value for ``?show_submitted=``
  on the dashboard or other review request listings.

  This wasn't really a user-facing problem, but could cause spurious log
  messages under certain conditions, such as when certain search bots
  crawled the site. Patch by Severin Gehwolf.

* Fixed a crash when attempting to log SSH-related problems.

* The contributed :file:`svn-hook-postcommit-review` script wasn't parsing
  the base path correctly. Patch by Lance Hudson.
