Review Board 1.5.3 Release Notes
================================


**Release date**: February 7, 2011


New Features
============

* Added support for matching repository names instead of paths with
  RBTools 0.3.1.

  Along with the new RBTools 0.3.1 release, we can now match a specific
  repository name (the same names you'd see in the New Review Request page)
  instead of a repository path. This helps administrators get around the
  problem of having too many possible repository paths (such as when there
  must be a username in the URL).

  This makes use of a ``REPOSITORY = "..."`` setting in
  :file:`.reviewboardrc`. You can set it to the exact name of the repository,
  or to a repository path.

  For more information, see the `REPOSITORY documentation`_ for post-review.

Bug Fixes
=========

* Fixed many compatibility issues with the new SSH implementation.

  The new SSH implementation added in 1.5.2 had a few regressions on
  certain configurations. Depending on your CVS, Bazaar, or Windows
  configuration, you may encounter certain bugs.

  We have now fixed all known bugs. This means CVS works, Bazaar works,
  and SSH on Windows works again. We've added tests to make sure these don't
  break again.

* Removed some spurious print statements causing mod_wsgi to have problems.
  (:bug:`1952`)

  We have some debugging statements left in that conflicted with
  mod_wsgi, breaking sites that accessed that code.

* The Search Index setting in the administration UI now validates the
  path to ensure that it's an absolute path, it exists, and it's writeable.
  Patch by Jan Koprowski. (:bug:`1831`)

* Updated the version of Python Setuptools that we install if the system
  doesn't already have it, since the version we used before no longer exists.
