=====================================
Review Board 1.0 RC 1 Release Notes
=====================================

**Release date**: May 3, 2009.


New Features
============

* Added an activity indicator at the top of the page to show when
  a request is being made. Examples include saving a comment,
  marking a change as submitted, or saving fields on a review request.
  This appears as a small but eye-catching box at the top of the
  page with a spiner, letting the user know that the request is still
  being processed. (:bug:`945`)

* Changed the :guilabel:`Ship It` column to show the number of reviews
  marked "ship it" next to the checkmark. This makes it easier to see at
  a glance how many people have signed off on the review request.

* Drastically sped up the dashboard. (:bug:`406`)

  We were making a lot of queries in the dashboard, depending on
  the columns used. In a worst-case scenario, this resulted in
  a few hundred queries.

  A lot of work has gone into reducing the number, which both
  lightens the load on the database server and speeds up loading
  the page.

* Added an :guilabel:`All My Requests` entry to the dashboard's sidebar,
  which shows all open and submitted review requests that the
  user has made. Patch by Noah Miller. (:bug:`503`)

* Added a field to the General Settings page for selecting the
  timezone. (:bug:`1038`)

* Added URL, bug number, and review request ID linkification to
  reviews and replies. This works the same way that review request
  linkification works. (:bug:`916`)

* Added support for using mod_fcgid on Apache through the
  generated fastcgi Apache configuration file. Patch by
  Mark Knittig.

* Added :kbd:`x` and :kbd:`c` shortcut keys in the diff viewer for going
  to the previous/next comment. This is useful on French keyboards
  that don't have :kbd:`[` and :kbd:`]` keys. (:bug:`1031`)

* rb-site now warns about missing dependencies before starting the
  install, and limits configuration to what's available. This
  prevents the case where people would get part-way through an
  install and see it fail due to a missing Python module or
  database server. (:bug:`755`, :bug:`756`)

* Made the user selection fields in the administration UI more
  usable. They now display as a side-by-side view, with selected
  users on the right, and the list of users is searchable. Patch
  by Eric Huss. (:bug:`912`)

* Improved compatibility with Active Directory servers, allowing
  for using a "custom search root" that administrators can override
  for specific setups, and for using the server's "mail" field when
  available for e-mail addresses. (:bug:`908`)

* Added subtle animations for the review draft banner, indicating
  whether we're creating a new review or discarding one.


Bugs Fixed
==========

* The review request page was "jumpy" on load. The review request
  and review draft banners would display after the page loaded.
  We now display these along with the page, minimizing the jumpiness
  of the page.

* Saved settings weren't always taking effect until after the server
  was restarted. (:bug:`734`)

* The comment dialog wasn't appearing on screenshots. (:bug:`1013`)

* The comment dialog width was incorrect when showing existing
  comments.

* The Registration page wasn't working after upgrading to beta 1
  until you forced a save on the General Settings page. (:bug:`1033`)

* Comment flags weren't always being shown on diffs. (:bug:`1028`)

* Site paths with spaces in the path resulted in broken web server
  configuration files. (:bug:`1015`)

* We were redirecting to the review request page when just saving
  a review, instead of staying on the same page. (:bug:`1056`)

* The left-hand side of a diff would be collapsed into a small
  column when showing an interdiff for a newly added file. (:bug:`730`)

* rb-site didn't properly allow for specifying a database host with
  a port number. Patch by Eric Huss.

* Different versions of a diff fragment were being cached with the
  same cache key, causing display problems when switching between
  diffs and interdiffs containing new or deleted files. This also
  broke anchors in the diff viewer. (:bug:`1036`)

* The review request page was caching the page contents without
  taking into account whether the user had a pending review or
  reply, making it appear as if the review/reply was lost.

* Linkified URLs were breaking when the URL was followed by an
  entity. Part of the entity was being embedded in the URL, breaking
  both the URL and the display. (:bug:`1069`)

* The black selection rectangle in the diff viewer was too far off
  to the left in Internet Explorer 8.

* Fixed some speed issues and warnings in our PNG transparency support
  for Internet Explorer 6. (:bug:`817`)

* LDAP and Active Directory broken on servers that don't support
  "givenName" and "sn" fields. (:bug:`891`)

* Bug tracker URLs that didn't include a ``%s`` marker caused breakages
  on review requests using bug numbers. (:bug:`1091`)

* The "Download Diff" link was displaying even when the diff wasn't
  accessible. We now use the same rules as we use for the "View Diff"
  link. Patch by Eric Huss.

* Clicking the edit icon (the pencil) on review requests sometimes
  caused the browser to scroll. (:bug:`1057`)
