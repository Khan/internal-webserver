Review Board 1.5.1 Release Notes
================================


**Release date**: November 20, 2010


New Features
============

* Permission denied errors are shown when accessing unreachable local
  Git repositories. (:bug:`1765`)

  Previously, if a Git repository was used and there wasn't sufficient
  file permissions to access it, a vague error saying that the repository
  was unreachable would appear. Now we check to find out if it's a
  permissions error, and display an appropriate error message.


Performance Improvements
========================

* Reduce the number of SQL queries in the legacy JSON API.

  Some of the legacy API handlers performed more queries than necessary.
  We now perform fewer queries. Patch by Ben Hollis.


Bug Fixes
=========

* Fixed several small problems in the Admin UI from bundling Django
  media files.

  For historical reasons, we've always shipped the Django Admin media files
  as part of Review Board. This comes from a time before rb-site existed,
  when we needed a single media directory with everything inside it. However,
  it just introduces various compatibility problems these days. We now make
  use of the media files that are installed with Django.

* Fixed a breakage in the diff viewer with SCons files. (:bug:`1864`)

  Any SCons files put up for review would break the diff viewer, due to a
  typo when looking up information on that type of file.

* Added the :guilabel:`Parent Diff` field to the New Review Request page.
  (:bug:`1651`)

  The :guilabel:`Parent Diff` field was missing for Git, Bazaar, and
  Mercurial, making it impossible to upload a parent diff through the
  web UI when creating a new review request.

* Fixed some common installation problems with the generated
  :file:`lighttpd.conf` file. (:bug:`1618`, :bug:`1639`)

  Several installs with lighttpd would give 404 Not Found errors, due to
  some configuration problems in the sample config file.

* Fixed support for multiple e-mail addresses assigned to a group.
  (:bug:`1661`)

  Multiple e-mail addresses for a group were supported, but broken in 1.5.
  We now split them out properly.

* The screenshot area is no longer hidden immediately after uploading a
  screenshot.

* Fixed an error in the web API when serializing to XML.

* Fixed broken intervals for search updating in the generated crontab file.

  The intervals would cause a full index to happen at every minute at
  2AM on Sundays, rather than only at 2AM.

* Fixed an error when permanently deleting a review request.

  The administrator-specific ability to permanently delete a review
  request would succeed but generate an error page.
* Fixed some compatibility problems with Django SVN.

  Production systems should never run against Django SVN, but for the purpose
  of development and forward-compatibility, we've made some changes to work
  with Django SVN. This does not ensure that it won't break in the future.
