======================================
Review Board 1.0 Alpha 4 Release Notes
======================================

**Release date**: February 16, 2009


Bugs fixed in Review Board
==========================

* Fixed an infinite loop in the Git diff parser. Patch by Dennis Sch√∂n.
  (:bug:`887`)

* The first file in the diff viewer would sometimes come back as
  escaped HTML. It's now embedded correctly.

* The comment dialog's "dirty" state wasn't being reset for new
  comments. This would leave reviewers unable to make new comments.


Bugs Fixed in post-review
=========================

* post-review should now work with SVN regardless of the locale set.
  (:bug:`888`)
