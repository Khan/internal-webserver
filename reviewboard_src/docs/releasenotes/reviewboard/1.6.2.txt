================================
Review Board 1.6.2 Release Notes
================================

**Release date**: November 9, 2011


New Features
============

* Staff members can now access all Local Sites.

  Server administrators can now view content on all Local Sites, instead of
  only the ones they're a part of.

* Auto-generated e-mails are now marked as "auto-generated" to avoid auto
  replies.

  This is recommended as per :rfc:`3834`. Patch by Erik Johansson.


API Changes
===========

* Added API for deleting review groups.

  Issuing a HTTP DELETE on a review group in the API will now delete that
  group if the caller has the appropriate permissions.

* Allow for archiving repositories.

  Updating a repository and passing ``archive_name=<value>`` will change
  the repository's name to an auto-generated, archived name. This is useful
  when deprecating a repository, and will prevent name clashes in the
  future.


Bug Fixes
=========

* Fixed the default Apache WSGI configuration for subdirectory installs.

  The default WSGI configuration had a WSGIScriptAlias setting that didn't
  work quite right for many users. Now, newly generated files should have a
  better default that works out of the box.

* Added explicit permisisions in the default Apache configurations.

  Depending on the default server configuration, several bits of media may
  break. We're now explicit in the configuration we need.

* The favicon for the page is now properly switching to the "New Updates"
  favicon on all browsers when there are review request updates.

* Specifying bug numbers on review requests without a repository no longer
  fails. (:bug:`2333`).

* Fixed saving captions for newly added screenshots and files.

* Fixed using special characters in SVN URLs.

  If an SVN URL contained any special characters (such as most Unicode
  characters), posting a review request would fail. The characters are now
  handled sanely. Patch by Ralph Habermann.

* Fixed Bazaar when pointing to a repository root that exists on the local
  filesystem. Patch by Michael Plump.

* Clicking Cancel on an "Add comment" box now fully removes the box, instead
  of leaving a bit of it behind.

* Fixed dashboard counters for brand new review requests on Local Sites.

* Group names in the dashboard are now ordered by name in the sidebar.

* Fixed a hard-coded media URL for the "Expand All" button.

  This would fail on subdirectory installations. Patch by Chris Tandiono.
  (:bug:`2343`)

* Fixed a problem with IE8 where the "Publish" button on comment dialogs
  weren't being shown.

* Fixed API authentication failures when ``:`` was in the password.
  Patch by Dave Druska. (:bug:`2334`)
