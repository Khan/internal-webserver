======================================
Review Board 1.0 Alpha 2 Release Notes
======================================

**Release date**: February 3, 2009


New Features
============

* Load times for nearly all parts of Review Board have greatly
  increased. The browser is now instructed to aggressively cache
  media files and many pages, meaning fewer downloads when going to
  any particular page.

  We optimize the order in which resources are loaded in order to
  take advantage of the browser's ability to parallelize downloads
  of similar resources types (such as CSS files or JavaScript).

  The results of these files are GZip'd to further increase transfer
  speeds.

  Apache users will get these improvements for free. lighttpd users
  will need to upgrade their lighttpd config file based on the
  template provided with Review Board in the contrib/conf/
  directory.

  On top of this, we now use jQuery 1.3.1, which is many times faster
  than the previous version of jQuery we were using, and we also
  have a number of improvements such as progressive loading of the
  diff viewer.

* Added progressive loading of the diff viewer. This is one of the
  main features of this release. Regardless of the size of the diff,
  the diff viewer now loads quickly, and loads each file's diff
  progressively. This gives people the ability to review code before
  all the diffs have even been generated.

  This also fixes some major scalability issues we've had with large
  diffs. In theory, it's now possible to review very large diffs
  that span many pages.

* Added support for linkifying pieces of text in the Description and
  Testing Done fields. (:bug:`258`)

  The following formats are supported:

  * URLs
  * ``/r/123`` numbers (even ``/r/123/diff`` and such)
  * bug/issue numbers (in the form of ``bug abc123``, ``bug #abc123``,
    ``issue abc123`` and ``issue #abc123``)

* Added support for Clearcase repositories. This depends on a mounted
  view on the Review Board server. Patch by Daniel Belz.


Feature Improvements
====================

* Improved lighttpd and Apache+fastcgi support. A Review Board
  install using either lighttpd or Apache+fastcgi should now work
  out of the box without setting up any custom scripts for launching
  fastcgi.

* The diff fragments placeholders in the review request page are now
  set to the same size as the fragment itself. This means that
  progressively loaded fragments should no longer cause the page
  to jump nearly as much, resulting in a smoother loading experience.

* When displaying the Review form, we now make sure that the form
  is scrolled to the top. This fixes a bug where the page was often
  scrolled to the bottom of the list of comments.

* Several improvements were made to Bazaar support. We now use
  bzrlib and support revid information in the diff header.

* The comment dialog is now slightly wider and has slightly smaller
  text, resulting in more room for comments.


Bugs Fixed in Review Board
==========================

* Whitespace from usernames are now stripped on LDAP accounts,
  which prevents duplicate user accounts in the database. (:bug:`728`)

* Fixed a bug where anchors in comment flags were incorrect and were
  getting lost when setting the comment count for the flag. This
  was breaking anchors to parts of the diff. (:bug:`820`)

* The fields in the comment dialog are now disabled if the user is
  not logged in. (:bug:`827`)

* Key presses in dialogs or in the review request details box no longer
  trigger navigation in the diff viewer. (:bug:`828`)

* The "Review" link on a review request is no longer displayed if
  the user is not logged in.

* Trailing whitespace wasn't shown in diff fragments on the
  review request page.

* Trailing whitespace wasn't always shown in the diff viewer, if
  it appeared in the middle of a comment block.

* Removed some old YUI files that were still in the repository.


Bugs Fixed in post-review
=========================

* We now strip the filename coming in from Perforce. There can be a trailing
  newline sometimes, resulting in a failed upload. (:bug:`726`)

* We set the correct locale now when invoking svn. Patch by
  Łukasz Jernaś. (:bug:`822`)

* Fixed backwards version comparison logic in post-review's GitClient.
  Patch by Stacey Sheldon.

* Added support for hgsubversion. Patch by Augie Fackler

* Added support for Clearcase. Patch by Daniel Belz.


Bugs Fixed in rb-site
=====================

* rb-site now sets ``postgresql_psycopg2`` as the ``DATABASE_ENGINE``
  for PostgreSQL installs. Patch by Rusty Burchfield. (:bug:`749`)

* rb-site should now generate config files that work correctly on
  Windows servers.
