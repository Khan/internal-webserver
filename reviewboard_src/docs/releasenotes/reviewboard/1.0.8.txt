Review Board 1.0.8 Release Notes
================================

**Release date**: May 12, 2010


Bugs Fixed
==========

* When clicking on a line number (either on the left-hand or right-hand side
  of the diff viewer) with an existing comment flag, we now open the existing
  comment instead of showing a blank comment dialog. (:bug:`1281`)

* Fixed some caching issues with the dashboard where two different review
  requests with identical subjects would link to the same review request.
  (:bug:`1582`)

* Fixed another caching issue with the dashboard where adding a column could
  cause the columns to be improperly rendered until the page was reloaded.

* The Review Board log file can now be rotated on Linux without interrupting
  logging or having to restart the web server.

* Fixed a small bug where error output was getting lumped together on the
  console when failing to register SCMTools.
