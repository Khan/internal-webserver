================================
Review Board 1.0.5 Release Notes
================================

**Release date**: October 22, 2009


Feature Improvements
====================

* The New Review Request page has been improved to have larger fields,
  help text, and to be consistent with the Upload Diff dialog. It also now
  recommends post-review, describes it briefly, and provides a link to it.
  (:bug:`1355`)


Bugs Fixed
==========

* There were some bad security vulnerabilities in Django 1.1. We now
  require Django 1.1.1 or higher, which contains some important security fixes.

* Binary files wouldn't appear in the diff viewer. We were accidentally
  filtering out binary files. (:bug:`1173`)

* Viewing a review request with no summary in the administration UI would
  fail with an error. We weren't returning a proper unicode string in this
  case, breaking the administration UI. (:bug:`1346`)

* The auto-size text areas were broken on Internet Explorer 6 and up.
  (:bug:`1349`)

* Entering long bug numbers on a review request would fail, causing a
  TypeError to be thrown during the AJAX request, which would in turn
  cause the JavaScript to fail. We now support long bug numbers properly.
  Patch by Thilo-Alexander Ginkel and Vladimir Sitnikov. (:bug:`1352`)

* The selection rectangle in the diff viewer wouldn't update properly when
  expanding part of a diff. We now reset the position on expand so it's not
  overlaying some random location. (:bug:`1353`)

* Expanding of files in the diff viewer were broken in a previous release for
  some cases. We now expand files correctly again.

* The Active Directory group enumeration logic was checking sAMAccountName
  instead of CN, causing problems in group enumeration. We now use the CN
  in the search query so that groups which have CNs that differ from their
  sAMAccountNames (e..g, if a "pre-Windows 2000" group name is set in Active
  Directory) will be included in the search results. Patch by Solomon
  Matthews.
