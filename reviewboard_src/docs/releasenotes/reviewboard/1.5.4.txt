Review Board 1.5.4 Release Notes
================================


**Release date**: February 20, 2011


New Features
============

* Added API support for creating/updating/removing repositories.

  The API now allows for creating repositories, updating existing ones,
  and removing them. This ability is restricted to administrators.

  The API can return a number of errors during repository verification,
  based on configuration problems or host access problems (such as bad or
  unknown SSH keys, or unknown HTTPS certificates). In the cases where it's
  host-related information tat needs to be verified, the API can respond
  to the error by repeating the request and sending ``trust_host=``.

  More information on using this new API is available in the
  `Repository API documentation`_.

* Added API for change number-related updates.

  A review request's information can now be updated based on a server-side
  changeset (when on repository types such as Perforce). The change number
  associated with a review request can also be updated. Both abilities were
  available in the old API, but not the new one.

  To update the review request's information based on a change number,
  issue an HTTP PUT with ``changenum=<changenum>`` with the existing change
  number. Specifying a different change number will attempt to update which
  changeset the review request is referencing and then update the information
  from that.


Bug Fixes
=========

* Fix validation problems with the Search Index settings in the Administration
  UI.

  Search Index validation made some faulty assumptions that prevented
  saving the General Settings page under many cases. This was actually
  hotfixed in 1.5.3.1, but no overall release announcement was made.

* Comments begining in expanded regions of a diff and ending in collapsed
  regions should no longer break the diff viewer. (:bug:`1564`)

* Usernames with ``@`` in the name (such as when using e-mail addresses
  as usernames) are now allowed. (:bug:`1712`)

* IntelliJ-generated SVN diffs should now be parsed properly. (:bug:`1937`)

* The ``update_changenum`` method in the old API no longer returns an
  HTTP 500 error. (:bug:`1948`)

* When replying to a review, names containing an apostrophe are no longer
  displayed incorrectly. (:bug:`1980`)

* Using a bug number on a review request without a repository no longer
  causes an HTTP 500 error. (:bug:`1982`)
