Bug Fixes
=========

* Fixed the Dashboard counters showing up as 0 or negative numbers.
  (:bug:`2268`)

  Some of the Dashboard review request counters were appearing as 0 after
  the upgrade to 1.6, and would turn negative after closing review requests.
  This was due to an incorrect default used when upgrading. The default has
  been fixed, and the counters will be recomputed after upgrading to 1.6.1.
