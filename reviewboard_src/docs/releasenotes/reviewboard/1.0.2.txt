Review Board 1.0.2 Release Notes
================================

**Release date**: September 15, 2009.


New Features
============

* Made SCMTool registration more flexible and bullet-proof. Previously, all
  of our built-in SCMTools had to have an entry with a specific ID in our
  database, and if an organization added a custom SCMTool to their database,
  it would break (:bug:`1272`). Now we look for new SCMTools registered with
  Review Board and dynamically register them in the database during a site
  upgrade.

  Third parties can now easily provide their own custom SCMTools without
  modifying Review Board. All that's needed is a Python package using
  setuptools that registers the SCMTool class using the
  ``reviewboard.scmtools`` entry point.

  This should not affect any existing installations with custom SCMTools.

* Improved logging of errors. If a 500 Internal Server Error is displayed,
  the actual reason for the error will appear in the system log file,
  along with the URL of the page and the user who tried to access it. This
  should greatly help administrators track down problems and report bugs
  back to us.


Bugs Fixed
==========

* The generated mod_python configuration file didn't support subdirectory
  installation out of the box. New users would have to hand-modify the
  configuration. It's now generated correctly, so users shouldn't hit this
  anymore.

* The reviewer's name wasn't always displayed in reply e-mails. It would
  simply appear blank. (:bug:`748`)

* The filename fields for diff files only allowed for filenames up to
  256 characters in length, which was often not enough (especially for
  ClearCase). We now support up to 1024 characters. (:bug:`751`)

* When attempting to submit as another user, without having the permissions
  to do so, the server would respond with a 500 Internal Server Error instead
  of a meaningful error. (:bug:`1067`)

* The :guilabel:`Bugs Closed` field on the Review Request administration
  page was too restrictive. It only allowed integers and commas, even though
  we support more than this for bug IDs. It will now accept pretty much
  anything. (:bug:`1149`)

* The Cache Stats page would sometimes say that the memcached server wasn't
  supported. This was due to parsing the user's memcached server string
  incorrectly. We now handle many more variations on this string.
  (:bug:`1196`)

* The ship-it counter didn't always increase, depending on the setup.
  Patch by Marc Bee. (:bug:`1200`)

* The :guilabel:`Server URL` field in the General Settings page in the
  administration UI was too strict, preventing URLs that didn't have a
  fully-qualified domain, such as ``reviewboard.internal`` or ``reviewboard``.
  This was overly restrictive for many people. We now except pretty much
  anything. (:bug:`1223`)

* Modifying a comment on a screenshot in the :guilabel:`Edit Review` dialog
  caused the thumbnail to point to the wrong screenshot. Patch by Eric Huss.
  (:bug:`1240`)

* The :mod:`crypt` and :mod:`nis` modules were always imported, even if they
  weren't needed. This was especially bad on Windows servers, as these modules
  are unavailable. This would make custom backends fail. Now we only import
  them as needed. Patch by Thilo-Alexander Ginkel. (:bug:`1244`)

* The ``@`` character wasn't considered a valid character in usernames in all
  places, even though it should be. This would lead to page errors. We now
  support this as part of usernames. (:bug:`1250`)

* The draft screenshot caption wasn't shown for screenshots on drafts of
  review requests. We would only show the published caption. Now we show
  whichever is appropriate. (:bug:`1257`)

* When browsing an interdiff, the :guilabel:`Expand` link wouldn't always
  work, generating an error instead. It should now work in every case.
  (:bug:`1285`)

* Excess whitespace is now stripped from the :guilabel:`Path` and
  :guilabel:`Mirror Path` fields on the Repository administration page. This
  helps prevent problems when copying and pasting paths into the page, which
  could lead to misleading errors. (:bug:`1286`)

* Review requests from inactive users (users who had their accounts disabled,
  due to spam or leaving the company, for example) would appear in the
  dashboard, despite not appearing in other lists. We now filter these out.
  The review request URLs will still work, though, meaning that they are not
  actually removed, just hidden from normal view. (:bug:`1290`)

* The :guilabel:`Save` and :guilabel:`Publish` buttons in the
  :guilabel:`Edit Review` dialog would only work once per page, requiring
  a page reload to make them work again. (:bug:`1292`)
