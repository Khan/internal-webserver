Creating Reviews
================

Adding comments on diffs, screenshots or file attachments will immediately
create a new review if one doesn't already exist. Once a review is created,
a :ref:`review draft banner <review-draft-banner>` will show on the page.

Blank reviews can also be created without having to first add a comment.
This can be useful if you have a generic comment about the change, rather
than one specific to diffs or other files.

To create a new, blank review, click :guilabel:`Review` on the review
request actions bar.

Editing Reviews
===============

Clicking the :guilabel:`Review` button on the review request action bar, or
clicking :guilabel:`Edit Review` on the review draft banner will display
dialog showing your review.

In this dialog, you can add a summary for your review,
:ref:`approve it <approving-changes>` for shipping, and edit your existing
comments.

The bottom of the dialog have the following buttons:

* :guilabel:`Publish Review`
* :guilabel:`Discard Review`
* :guilabel:`Cancel`
* :guilabel:`Save`

Clicking :guilabel:`Publish Review` will save any comments you have made on
your review and immediately `publish your review <publishing-reviews>`_.

Clicking :guilabel:`Discard Review` will immediately discard your review.

Clicking :guilabel:`Cancel` will discard any new changes you've made in the
dialog, but keep your review around if this wasn't a new one.

Clicking :guilabel:`Save` will save any comments you have made on your
review and close the dialog.
