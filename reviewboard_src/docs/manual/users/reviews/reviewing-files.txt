Reviewing File Attachments
==========================

.. versionadded:: 1.6

Reviewers can add comments to file attachments as a whole. Review Board
doesn't provide any special UI for reviewing the contents of file attachments,
but it does allow you to download the file and, separately, add a comment on
the file.

The file attachment box provides a :guilabel:`Add Comment` button. Clicking
this button pops up a comment dialog that works exactly like the dialog you
get when :doc:`reviewing diffs <reviewing-diffs>` or
:doc:`reviewing screenshots <reviewing-screenshots>`.

The file attachment comment dialog supports issue tracking. See the section on
:ref:`issue-tracking` for more information.

As of Review Board 1.6.0, there's no visual indication of an existing comment
on the file attachment. However, you can see your comment and edit it by
clicking :guilabel:`Add Comment` again.
