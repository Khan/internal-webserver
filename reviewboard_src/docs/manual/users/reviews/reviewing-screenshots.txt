Reviewing Screenshots
=====================

Overview
========

Much like diffs, portions of screenshots can be reviewed. This is useful
when presenting screenshots of a new dialog, for example, where the design
and layout of the dialog is as important as the code constructing it.

To begin reviewing a screenshot, just click the thumbnail for the screenshot
on the review request page.


Commenting on Regions
=====================

To place a new comment on part of the screenshot, simply click and drag to
select the desired area. You might want to click and drag over a button in the
screenshot, for example. This will pop open a new comment dialog, just like in
the diff viewer.

The screenshot comment dialog supports issue tracking. See the section on
:ref:`issue-tracking` for more information.

Once you're done writing your comment in the text area, click :guilabel:`Save`
to save the comment.

A rectangle with a green number box will appear in the region you selected to
indicate that you have a comment in that area. Click the box to pop open the
comment box for your existing comment again.


Reading Existing Comments
=========================

When your mouse cursor is over the screenshot, regions representing other
comments may appear with blue number boxes in the corner. Each of these is a
comment someone has made on another review.

If you move the mouse cursor over the region, a tooltip will appear
showing a summary of the comments made.

If you click on the region, the comment dialog will appear, along with a blue
side panel on the left showing those existing comments. You can still write
new comments in the green area of the comment box.

It's important to note that this is meant to be used as a reference to see if
other people have already said what you plan to say. The comment box is
**not** the place to reply to those comments. Instead, you can click the
:guilabel:`Reply` link next to the particular comment, which will take you
back to the review request page and open a reply box.
