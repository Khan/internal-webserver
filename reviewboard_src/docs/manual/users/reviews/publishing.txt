Publishing Reviews
==================

You can publish your review by clicking :guilabel:`Publish Review` on the
:ref:`review draft banner <review-draft-banner>` or
:ref:`review dialog <review-dialog>`.

Publishing your review will add a review to the review request page showing
all your comments. The developer or other reviewers can reply to your
comments, discussing the changes with you.

If the administrator has enabled e-mail support, the owner of the review
request and all existing reviewers will be e-mailed a copy of your new review.

Once you have published a review, you can't go back and edit it.
