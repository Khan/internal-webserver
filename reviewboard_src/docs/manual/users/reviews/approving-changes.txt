============================
Approving Changes (Ship It!)
============================

To mark your approval for a change to be submitted on your review, check the
:guilabel:`Ship It` checkbox on the review dialog. Your review will have a
green "Ship It!" label indicating your go-ahead for the developer to submit
the change.

It is up to your organization to decide how Ship Its are used. Review Board
doesn't enforce any policy about who can mark a review as Ship It, and doesn't
require a Ship It to close a review request.

Once a review has been marked Ship It and published, it cannot be undone.

If you're approving a change and you don't have any other comments to add, you
can click the :guilabel:`Ship It!` button on the review request action bar
instead. A confirmation dialog will appear asking if you're sure, and once
given permission, it will create and publish a new review saying "Ship It!"
