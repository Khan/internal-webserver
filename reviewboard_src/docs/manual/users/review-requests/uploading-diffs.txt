Uploading Diffs
===============

A review request's diff can be updated by clicking :guilabel:`Upload Diff`
or :guilabel:`Update Diff` on the action bar. It will present a dialog much
like the New Review Request page.

See :ref:`review-requests-for-diffs` for more information on the fields.


.. note:: It's usually best to use :ref:`post-review` or another tool
          to update a diff, instead of uploading using this dialog.
          This will help guarantee a valid diff, and works around problems
          in some diff formats.
