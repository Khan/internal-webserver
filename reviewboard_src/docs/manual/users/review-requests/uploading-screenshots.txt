Uploading Screenshots
=====================

Screenshots or other images can be added to a review request. These can
be helpful in seeing how the change affects the presentation of a program,
or they can be used for reviewing mockups.

There are two ways to upload a screenshot:

1. Click :guilabel:`Add Screenshot` on the action bar, browse for the
   file to upload, and optionally enter a caption for the screenshot.

   .. image:: add-screenshot-dialog.png

2. Drag the screenshot from your file manager into the review request.

   When dragging over the browser window, a black overlay will appear,
   showing you where to drop the screenshot to upload it. You also have
   the option of :ref:`uploading a file attachment <uploading-files>`.

   When you drop the file, the overlay will disappear and the file will
   upload.

   You can drag and upload multiple screenshots at a time.

   Note that this requires a modern HTML5-capable browser, such as
   Google Chrome or Firefox 3.6+.
