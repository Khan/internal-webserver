Publishing Review Requests
==========================

As soon as you make any change to a review request, a draft banner will appear
above the review request asking you to optionally describe your changes. This
is handy when you've actually uploaded a new diff and want to say what changed
in that diff.

When you're finished, click :guilabel:`Publish Changes`. If you decided you
didn't want to make those changes, you can click :guilabel:`Discard Draft`
instead.

Depending on your particular setup, publishing a draft may send
an e-mail out to the reviewers, letting them know your change is ready to
reviewed again.
