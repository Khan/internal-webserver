Uploading File Attachments
==========================

.. versionadded:: 1.6

Any type of file can be added to a review request. Log files, binaries,
test data, audio, or anything else. These files can be downloaded by
other people. This is especially helpful for files that are part of a change
but can't be represented in diffs.

Comments can be made on file attachments by clicking :guilabel:`Add Comment`.
These comments apply to file attachments as a whole. See
:ref:`reviewing-file-attachments` for more information.

There are two ways to upload a file attachment:

1. Click :guilabel:`Add File` on the action bar, browse for the
   file to upload, and optionally enter a caption for the file.

2. Drag the file from your file manager into the review request.

   When dragging over the browser window, a black overlay will appear,
   showing you where to drop the screenshot to upload it. You also have
   the option of :ref:`uploading a screenshot <uploading-screenshots>`.

   When you drop the file, the overlay will disappear and the file will
   upload.

   You can drag and upload multiple files at a time.

   Note that this requires a modern HTML5-capable browser, such as
   Google Chrome or Firefox 3.6+.
