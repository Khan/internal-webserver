Review Board sites can be configured through the Settings portion of the
:ref:`Administration UI <administration-ui>`. You'll generally need to make
some changes in here before others use the site.

Clicking on :guilabel:`Settings` anywhere in the
:ref:`Administration UI <administration-ui>` will take you to the
:ref:`general-settings` page. The navigation bar below the main administration
navigation bar contains links for jumping to the other available settings
pages, which consists of:

   authentication-settings
   email-settings
   diffviewer-settings
   logging-settings
   ssh-settings
   file-storage-settings
