General Settings
================

The General Settings page contains most of the settings you'll want to change
for a new site. It's split up into the following sections:

* :ref:`site-settings`
* :ref:`search-settings`


.. _site-settings:

Site Settings
=============

In this section you'll specify where the server lives (on the Internet and
geographically) and administrator contacts.

The following settings can be configured:

* **Server:**
    The URL of the site. This should include the ``http://`` or
    ``https://`` but should not contain the subdirectory Review Board
    is set up to use.

    This setting is required.

* **Media URL:**
    The URL to the media files. This can point to a dedicated
    server, or it can be a path relative to installed Review Board
    site.

    This setting is optional, and if left blank, the default
    media path of ``/media/`` is used.

* **Administrator Name:**
    The full name of the primary administrator for this Review Board site.

    This setting is required.

* **Administrator E-Mail:**
    The e-mail address of the primary administrator for this Review Board
    site.

    This setting is required.

* **Time Zone:**
    The time zone where the server resides. All the timestamps shown for
    review requests will be based on this time zone.

    It's important to note that changing the time zone will have no effect
    on any existing review requests. It will only take effect for new
    review requests. This is due to a limitation in how the timestamps are
    stored, and is beyond our control.


.. _search-settings:

Search
======

* **Enable search:**
    If enabled, a search field is provided at the top of every page to
    quickly search through review requests.

    This feature depends on a working :ref:`installing-pylucene` and
    regular :ref:`search-indexing` to work.


.. _search-index-directory:

* **Search index directory:**
    The directory on the server's file system where the search index files
    will be stored. This defaults to a directory named "search-index" in the
    site's directory, if left blank.

    Either absolute or relative paths can be provided. A relative path will
    always be relative to the site directory.

    This option is only available if search is enabled.
