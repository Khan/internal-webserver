.. _auth-general-settings:

General Settings
================

In this section you'll chose the type of authentication you'll be allowing
on the site (LDAP, Active Directory, etc.) and whether or not anonymous
users can access the site.

The following settings can be configured:

* **Allow anonymous read-only access:**
    Determines whether or not anonymous users should be able to view
    posted review requests and diffs.

    This is often safe to enable when the code being posted is public or when
    there's strict access controls to the site itself. If the code is
    confidential and it's possible for people without authority to access
    the server, this should be disabled.


.. _`Authentication Method`:
.. _authentication-method:

* **Authentication Method:**
    The method used for authenticating users on this Review Board server.

    Review Board has multiple ways of authenticating users. By default,
    "Standard registration" is used, but other methods can be selected. See
    :ref:`Authentication` for more information.

    Depending on the authentication method selected, additional settings may
    be available.

    Available options are:

    * Standard registration
    * Active Directory
    * LDAP
    * NIS
    * X.509 Public Key
    * Legacy Authentication Module


.. _basic-authentication-settings:

Basic Authentication Settings
=============================

This is available if `Authentication Method`_ is set to
``Standard registration``.

* **Enable registration:**
    You can use this to control whether or not new users can register accounts
    on the server.

    It may be useful to turn off registration if you're carefully controlling
    who's allowed to post on your server, or if you're being flooded with
    spam users.

* **Show a captcha for registration:**
    Public Review Board servers may encounter spam accounts from time to time.
    You can help prevent these by turning on captchas for registration.

    Review Board uses reCAPTCHA_ for its captcha system. reCAPTCHA is a
    widely used and maintained captcha system. In order to use it, you will
    need to register an account and fill in the following two fields with the
    public and private keys that the site provides.

* **reCAPTCHA Public Key:**
    The public key provided by the reCAPTCHA site registration for your site.

* **reCAPTCHA Private Key:**
    The private key provided by the reCAPTCHA site registration for your site.

.. _reCAPTCHA: http://www.google.com/recaptcha

    For example: ``MYDOMAIN``

    This setting is required.

    option is more secure, but must be enabled on the AD server.

* **Find DC from DNS:**
    If checked, find the Domain Controller from DNS.

* **Domain controller:**
    Enter the name or IP address of the Domain Controller of not using DNS lookup.

* **OU name:**
    Optionally restrict users to specified OU.

* **Group name:**
    Optionally restrict users to a specified group.

* **Custom search root:**
    Optionally specify a custom search root, overriding the built-in computed
    search root. If set, "OU name" is ignored.

* **Recursion Depth:**
    Depth to recurse when checking group membership. Set to 0 to turn off,
    -1 for unlimited.

.. _ldap-authentication-settings:

* **LDAP Server:**
    The LDAP server to authenticate with.
    For example: ``ldap://localhost:389``

    This setting is required.

* **LDAP Base DN:**
    The LDAP Base DN for performing LDAP searches.

    This setting is required.

* **E-Mail Domain:**
    The domain name appended to the user's login name to form the e-mail
    address. For example: ``example.com``

    This setting is required.

* **Use TLS for authentication:**
    If checked, then TLS will be used for all authentication requests. This
    option is more secure, but must be enabled on the LDAP server.

* **User Mask:**
    The string representing the user. The string must contain the text
    ``%s`` where the username would normally go.
    For example: ``(uid=%s)``

    This setting is required.

    format as User Mask.

    disabled.
