/**
 * Simple JS API for the Flash Aphlict client. Example usage:
 *
 *   var aphlict = new JX.Aphlict('aphlict_swf', '127.0.0.1', 2600)
 *     .setHandler(function(type, message) {
 *       JX.log("Got " + type + " event!")
 *     })
 *     .start();
 *
 * Your handler will receive these events:
 *
 *  - `connect` The client initiated a connection to the server.
 *  - `connected` The client completed a connection to the server.
 *  - `close` The client disconnected from the server.
 *  - `error` There was an error.
 *  - `receive` Received a message from the server.
 *
 * You do not have to handle any of them in any specific way.
