WHAT IS JAVELIN?

Javelin is a compact Javascript library built around event delegation. Its
primary design goal is performance; it is consequently well-suited to projects
where performance is very important. It is not as good for smaller scale
projects where other concerns (like features or ease of development) are more
important.


PACKAGES

Packages come in two flavors: "dev" and "min". The "dev" packages are intended
for development, and have comments and debugging code. The "min" packages have
the same code, but with comments and debugging information stripped out and
symbols crushed. They are intended for use in production -- ha ha ha!
