@title Installation Guide
@group intro

This document contains basic install instructions to get Phabricator up and
running.

= Installation Requirements =

Phabricator is a LAMP application suite, so you basically need LAMP:

  - **Linux**: Some flavor of Linux is required. Mac OS X is an acceptable
    flavor of Linux. Windows is not an acceptable flavor of Linux. Phabricator
    will not install or work properly on Windows. (If you want it to, send
    patches.) Phabricator has active contributors running it on Mac OS X, Amazon
    Linux, Ubuntu, RHEL and CentOS; if you run into issues on other flavors,
    send patches or complaints.
  - **Apache** (or nginx, or lighttpd): You need Apache 2.2.7+ (or another
    tested webserver). You can probably use something else, but you're
    on your own.
  - **MySQL**: You need MySQL.
  - **PHP**: You need PHP 5.2 or newer.

NOTE: The command line interface to Phabricator, "Arcanist", //does// work on
Windows. For instructions, see @{article:Arcanist User Guide: Windows}.

You'll probably also need a **domain name** and you'll certainly need
**a computer** with a connection to **the internet**.

= Installing Required Components =

If you are installing on Ubuntu or an RedHat derivative, there are install
scripts available which should handle most of the things discussed in this
document for you:

  - **RedHat Derivatives**:
    <http://www.phabricator.com/rsrc/install/install_rhel-derivs.sh>
  - **Ubuntu**: <http://www.phabricator.com/rsrc/install/install_ubuntu.sh>

If those work for you, you can skip directly to the
@{article:Configuration Guide}. These scripts are also available in the
##scripts/install## directory in the project itself.

Otherwise, here's a general description of what you need to install:

  - git (usually called "git" in package management systems)
  - Apache (usually "httpd" or "apache2") (or nginx)
  - MySQL Server (usually "mysqld" or "mysql-server")
  - PHP (usually "php")
  - Required PHP extensions: mbstring, iconv, mysql (or mysqli), curl, pcntl
    (these might be something like "php-mysql" or "php5-mysql")
  - Optional PHP extensions: gd, apc (special instructions for APC are available
    below if you have difficulty installing it), xhprof (instructions below,
    you only need this if you are developing Phabricator)

If you already have LAMP setup, you've probably already got everything you need.
It may also be helpful to refer to the install scripts above, even if they don't
work for your system.

Now that you have all that stuff installed, grab Phabricator and its
dependencies:

  $ cd somewhere/ # pick some install directory
  somewhere/ $ git clone git://github.com/facebook/libphutil.git
  somewhere/ $ git clone git://github.com/facebook/arcanist.git
  somewhere/ $ git clone git://github.com/facebook/phabricator.git
  somewhere/ $ cd phabricator
  somewhere/phabricator/ $ git submodule update --init

= Installing APC (Optional) =

Like everything else written in PHP, Phabricator will run much faster with APC
installed. You likely need to install "pcre-devel" first:

  sudo yum install pcre-devel

Then you have two options. Either install via PECL (try this first):

  sudo yum install php-pear
  sudo pecl install apc

**If that doesn't work**, grab the package from PECL directly and follow the
build instructions there:

  http://pecl.php.net/package/APC

Installing APC is optional but **strongly recommended**, especially on
production hosts.

Once APC is installed, test that it is available by running:

  php -i | grep apc

If it doesn't show up, add:

  extension=apc.so

..to "/etc/php.d/apc.ini" or the "php.ini" file indicated by "php -i".

= Installing XHProf (Optional) =

XHProf is a PHP profiling tool. You don't need to install it unless you are
developing Phabricator and making performance changes.

You can install xhprof with:

  $ pecl install xhprof

If you have a PEAR version prior to 1.9.3, you may run into a `phpize` failure.
If so, you can download the source and build it with:

  $ cd extension/
  $ phpize
  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ sudo make install

You may also need to add "##extension=xhprof.so##" to your php.ini.

See <https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=59747> for more information.

= Updating Phabricator =

Since Phabricator is under active development, you should update frequently. To
update Phabricator:

  - Stop the webserver.
  - Run `git pull && git submodule update --init` in `libphutil/`,
    `arcanist/` and `phabricator/`.
  - Run `phabricator/bin/storage upgrade`.
  - Restart the webserver.

For more details, see @{article:Configuration Guide}. You can use a script
similar to this one to automate the process:
