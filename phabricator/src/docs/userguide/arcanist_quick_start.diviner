Quick guide to getting Arcanist working for a new project.

This is a summary of steps to install Arcanist, configure a project for use with
it, and run `arc` to send changes for review.

= Install Arcanist =

For detailed instructions on installing Arcanist, see
@{article:Arcanist User Guide}.

  - For Mac OS X, see @{article:Arcanist User Guide: Mac OS X}.
  - For Windows, see @{article:Arcanist User Guide: Windows}.

First, install dependencies:

  - Install PHP.
  - Install Git.

Then install Arcanist itself:

  $ mkdir somewhere/
  $ cd somewhere/
  somewhere/ $ git clone git://github.com/facebook/libphutil.git
  somewhere/ $ git clone git://github.com/facebook/arcanist.git

Add `arc` to your path:

  $ export PATH="$PATH:/somewhere/arcanist/bin/"

This won't work for Windows, see @{article:Arcanist User Guide: Windows} for
instructions.

= Configure Your Project =

For detailed instructions on project configuration, see
@{article:Arcanist User Guide: Configuring a New Project}.

Create a `.arcconfig` file in your project's working copy:

  $ cd yourproject/
  yourproject/ $ $EDITOR .arcconfig
  yourproject/ $ cat .arcconfig
  {
    "project_id" : "yourprojectname",
    "conduit_uri" : "https://phabricator.example.com/"
  }

Set `project_id` to a string that identifies the project.

Set `conduit_uri` to the URI for your Phabricator install (where `arc`
should send changes to).

NOTE: You should **commit this file** to the repository.

= Install Arcanist Credentials =

Credentials allow you to authenticate. You must have an account on Phabricator
before you can perform this step.

  $ cd yourproject/
  yourproject/ $ arc install-certificate
  ...

Follow the instructions. This will link your user account on your local machine
to your Phabricator account.

= Send Changes For Review =

For detailed instructions on using `arc diff`, see
@{article:Arcanist User Guide: arc diff}.

  $ $EDITOR file.c
  $ arc diff
