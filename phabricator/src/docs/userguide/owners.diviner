@title Owners Tool User Guide
@group userguide

Use Owners to define and/or monitor code you care about.

= Packages =

Owners tool allows you to define a code package by specifying a group of paths.
The package can then be used to monitor the paths. For example, it can be used
in Herald rules and in the "Related Commits" feature (see below).

= Related Commits =

Once the package is defined, all future commits touching any path defined in
the package will be recorded as "Related Commits" of the package.

= Commits Needing Attention =

Owners tool enables the owners of the package to monitor the commits that might
need attention. If "auditing" is enabled for a package, a related commit will
be marked as "Needing Attention" if

  - it's neither authored nor reviewed by an owner of the package,
  - no revision found for the commit,
  - the commit author is not recognized, or
  - the author or the reviewer specified in the commits don't match the ones in
  the Differential revision

The owners of the package can accept or specify concern for such commits by
clicking the "Audit Status" link.
