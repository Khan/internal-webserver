    $send_as_user_desc = $this->deformat(pht(<<<EODOC
When a user takes an action which generates an email notification (like
commenting on a Differential revision), Phabricator can either send that mail
"From" the user's email address (like "alincoln@logcabin.com") or "From" the
'metamta.default-address' address.

The user experience is generally better if Phabricator uses the user's real
address as the "From" since the messages are easier to organize when they appear
in mail clients, but this will only work if the server is authorized to send
email on behalf of the "From" domain. Practically, this means:

  - If you are doing an install for Example Corp and all the users will have
    corporate @corp.example.com addresses and any hosts Phabricator is running
    on are authorized to send email from corp.example.com, you can enable this
    to make the user experience a little better.
  - If you are doing an install for an open source project and your users will
    be registering via Facebook and using personal email addresses, you probably
    should not enable this or all of your outgoing email might vanish into SFP
    blackholes.
  - If your install is anything else, you're safer leaving this off, at least
    initially, since the risk in turning it on is that your outgoing mail will
    never arrive.

    $one_mail_per_recipient_desc = $this->deformat(pht(<<<EODOC
When a message is sent to multiple recipients (for example, several reviewers on
a code review), Phabricator can either deliver one email to everyone (e.g., "To:
alincoln, usgrant, htaft") or separate emails to each user (e.g., "To:
alincoln", "To: usgrant", "To: htaft"). The major advantages and disadvantages
of each approach are:

  - One mail to everyone:
    - Recipients can see To/Cc at a glance.
    - If you use mailing lists, you won't get duplicate mail if you're
      a normal recipient and also Cc'd on a mailing list.
    - Getting threading to work properly is harder, and probably requires
      making mail less useful by turning off options.
    - Sometimes people will "Reply All" and everyone will get two mails,
      one from the user and one from Phabricator turning their mail into
      a comment.
    - Not supported with a private reply-to address.
    - Mails are sent in the server default translation.
  - One mail to each user:
    - Recipients need to look in the mail body to see To/Cc.
    - If you use mailing lists, recipients may sometimes get duplicate
      mail.
    - Getting threading to work properly is easier, and threading settings
      can be customzied by each user.
    - "Reply All" no longer spams all other users.
    - Required if private reply-to addresses are configured.
    - Mails are sent in the language of user preference.

In the code, splitting one outbound email into one-per-recipient is sometimes
referred to as "multiplexing".

    $bulk_description = $this->deformat(pht(<<<EODOC
If this option is enabled, Phabricator will add a "Precedence: bulk" header to
transactional mail (e.g., Differential, Maniphest and Herald notifications).
This may improve the behavior of some auto-responder software and prevent it
from replying. However, it may also cause deliverability issues -- notably, you
currently can not send this header via Amazon SES, and enabling this option with
SES will prevent delivery of any affected mail.
EODOC

    $re_prefix_description = $this->deformat(pht(<<<EODOC
Mail.app on OS X Lion won't respect threading headers unless the subject is
prefixed with "Re:". If you enable this option, Phabricator will add "Re:" to
the subject line of all mail which is expected to thread. If you've set
'metamta.one-mail-per-recipient', users can override this setting in their
preferences.
EODOC

    $vary_subjects_description = $this->deformat(pht(<<<EODOC
If true, allow MetaMTA to change mail subjects to put text like '[Accepted]' and
'[Commented]' in them. This makes subjects more useful, but might break
threading on some clients. If you've set 'metamta.one-mail-per-recipient', users
can override this setting in their preferences.
EODOC

    $reply_to_description = $this->deformat(pht(<<<EODOC
If you enable {{metamta.public-replies}}, Phabricator uses "From" to
authenticate users. You can additionally enable this setting to try to
authenticate with 'Reply-To'. Note that this is completely spoofable and
insecure (any user can set any 'Reply-To' address) but depending on the nature
of your install or other deliverability conditions this might be okay.
Generally, you can't do much more by spoofing Reply-To than be annoying (you can
write but not read content). But this is still **COMPLETELY INSECURE**.

    $adapter_description = $this->deformat(pht(<<<EODOC
Adapter class to use to transmit mail to the MTA. The default uses
PHPMailerLite, which will invoke "sendmail". This is appropriate if sendmail
actually works on your host, but if you haven't configured mail it may not be so
great. A number of other mailers are available (e.g., SES, SendGrid, SMTP,
custom mailers), consult "Configuring Outbound Email" in the documentation for
details.

    $placeholder_description = $this->deformat(pht(<<<EODOC
When sending a message that has no To recipient (i.e. all recipients are CC'd,
for example when multiplexing mail), set the To field to the following value. If
no value is set, messages with no To will have their CCs upgraded to To.
EODOC
));

    $public_replies_description = $this->deformat(pht(<<<EODOC
By default, Phabricator generates unique reply-to addresses and sends a separate
email to each recipient when you enable reply handling. This is more secure than
using "From" to establish user identity, but can mean users may receive multiple
emails when they are on mailing lists. Instead, you can use a single, non-unique
reply to address and authenticate users based on the "From" address by setting
this to 'true'. This trades away a little bit of security for convenience, but
it's reasonable in many installs. Object interactions are still protected using
hashes in the single public email address, so objects can not be replied to
blindly.
EODOC
));

    $single_description = $this->deformat(pht(<<<EODOC
If you want to use a single mailbox for Phabricator reply mail, you can use this
and set a common prefix for reply addresses generated by Phabricator. It will
make use of the fact that a mail-address such as
`phabricator+D123+1hjk213h@example.com` will be delivered to the `phabricator`
user's mailbox. Set this to the left part of the email address and it will be
prepended to all generated reply addresses.

For example, if you want to use `phabricator@example.com`, this should be set
to `phabricator`.
