# Httpful

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/nategood/httpful.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/nategood/httpful)

[Httpful](http://phphttpclient.com) is a simple Http Client library for PHP 5.3+.  There is an emphasis of readability, simplicity, and flexibility â€“ basically provide the features and flexibility to get the job done and make those features really easy to use.

Features

 - Readable HTTP Method Support (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, HEAD, PATCH and OPTIONS)
 - Custom Headers
 - Automatic "Smart" Parsing
 - Automatic Payload Serialization
 - Basic Auth
 - Client Side Certificate Auth
 - Request "Templates"

# Sneak Peak

Here's something to whet your appetite.  Search the twitter API for tweets containing "#PHP".  Include a trivial header for the heck of it.  Notice that the library automatically interprets the response as JSON (can override this if desired) and parses it as an array of objects.

    $url = "http://search.twitter.com/search.json?q=" . urlencode('#PHP');
    $response = Request::get($url)
        ->withXTrivialHeader('Just as a demo')
        ->send();

    foreach ($response->body->results as $tweet) {
        echo "@{$tweet->from_user} tweets \"{$tweet->text}\"\n";
    }

# Installation

## Phar

A [PHP Archive](http://php.net/manual/en/book.phar.php) (or .phar) file is available for [downloading](https://github.com/nategood/httpful/downloads).  Simply [download](https://github.com/nategood/httpful/downloads) the .phar, drop it into your project, and include it like you would any other php file.  _This method is ideal smaller projects, one off scripts, and quick API hacking_.

    <?php
    include('httpful.phar');
    $r = \Httpful\Request::get($uri)->sendIt();
    ...

## Composer

Httpful is PSR-0 compliant and can be installed using [composer](http://getcomposer.org/).  Simply add `nategood/httpful` to your composer.json file.  _Composer is the sane alternative to PEAR.  It is excellent for managing dependancies in larger projects_.

    {
        "require": {
            "nategood/httpful": "*"
        }
    }

## Install from Source

Because Httpful is PSR-0 compliant, you can also just clone the Httpful repository and use a PSR-0 compatible autoloader to load the library, like [Symfony's](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/class_loader.html). Alternatively you can use the PSR-0 compliant autoloader included with the Httpful (simply `require("bootstrap.php")`).
