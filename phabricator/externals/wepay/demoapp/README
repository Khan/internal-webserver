After registering your application at wepay.com (or stage.wepay.com), you
need to make two updates to this application:

1 - set your client_id and client_secret in _shared.php
2 - set the redirect_uri in login.php

That should be enough to start making API calls against WePay's API.  While
this is by no means a production-ready example, it should provide you a 
couple ideas on how to get running.

It also defaults to requesting all possible scope fields in the
authentication request. We suggest limiting the request to the minimum
your application requires, which will maximize the chance the user
grants permissions to your application. You can customize this in
login.php.

If you have any questions, please contact the API team: api@wepay.com
