Access Control -> Jenkin's own user database
Allow users to sign up:  <checked>

-- http://ci.khanacademy.org/signup
-- Create admin user

Username:        jenkins-admin
Password:        ***

-- http://ci.khanacademy.org/configure
-- Restrict to admin user, make anonymous read-only

-- Install plugins

* Cobertura
* Disk Usage
* Email-ext
* EnvInject
* HipChat
* HTML Publisher
* Mercurial
* thinBackup

Plugins that are too new for the install jenkins might need to be
installed by hand: https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Plugins

With jenkins 1.409.1 installed, an older email-ext and its maven
dependency are needed.

$ sudo wget http://updates.jenkins-ci.org/download/plugins/email-ext/2.14.1/email-ext.hpi
$ sudo wget https://updates.jenkins-ci.org/download/plugins/maven-plugin/1.399/maven-plugin.hpi
$ sudo chown jenkins:jenkins email-ext.hpi maven-plugin.hpi
$ sudo service jenkins restart

-- Troubleshooting HipChat

If HipChat notifications are failing it may have to do with SSL certificate
signing. Check for security errors in the logs (/var/log/jenkins/jenkins.log).

OpenJDK ships with empty certificates. One solution is to install the Sun JDK
with its valid certificates and point OpenJDK at them:

  1. Install the Sun JDK
     $ sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jdk

  2. Point OpenJDK at the Sun JDK certificates
     $ cd /etc/ssl/certs/java
     $ sudo mv cacerts cacerts.old
     $ sudo ln -sn /etc/java-6-sun/security/cacerts
